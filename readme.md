## The Invasion of Earth is at hand!
March 15th 2270...in the last centuries, humanity struggled because of war, epidemics and economical crisis. The global situation is about to turn for the better.
But then, research satellites have detected a rush of giant objects travelling towards Earth. The Global World Initiative has commenced a defensive operation.
It seems this is the one time at which humanity must come together, without room for errors and misunderstanding. A war against interstellar forces has started...
However, there is one special unit ordered to take out the root of the evil. It is YOU! Are you ready to be the final fate which decides the outcome?

## Your mission

Elimate all enemies at sight and trace back the origin of the troops. Nobody knows how far you need to travel into the unknown universe and where your true adversary awaits.
Use your space ship and all power-ups wisely!

## The controls
#### Classical: Keyboard and gamepad (PC)
 You can control the game with the arrow keys and the space key on your keyboard or by going ahead and use a gamepad with an analogue stick and a designated fire button (chosen by pressing it on the title screen). 
You can pause the game using the "P" button if you use a keyboard or key 09 (mostly known as "The start button") if you use a gamepad.
#### New: Touch controls
A recent addition to the game are touch controls! Just press anywhere on the touch screen of your device (at the title screen) to activate them!
At the lower left, you will find your D-Pad, above that, the pause button. To the right, this is your fire button. Make extensive use of this!


## Difficulty selection

The game offers four difficulty levels in order to customize the challenge you are seeking.
Every difficulty has its own combination of damage done by enemy units and subtile change3 in game play.
In Beginner and Normal, you shoot three bullets at a time and play four levels. In Hard and Master you
only shoot two bullets, play five levels and must expect that some troops and traps may cost you a life
instantly.

## Ways to prepare and play the game

There are severals for you to play the game. Decide which one you like to use. \
\
**1) Give it a quick look on my server** \
If you do not want any big setup, but simply a quick round of action, you should definitely look [here](https://manuel-engel.de/finalfate/finalfate). \
\
**2) Locally storing the files and directly opening the html file** \
Clone the repository, or, if Git is not your tool of choice (How did you find me in this case? Let me know.), you can manually download the respective files. Mandatory downloads are index.html and all the .js files in the finalfate directory, the sound files are optional. Please include a copy of the license file when making the game available to others. \
\
**3) Serving the game's files over a webserver** \
Follow the 2nd option "Locally storing the files" and either host the game on your computer or a web hosting provider you trust.
This way needs a bit more technical knowledge, but the advantage is that your family at home or possibly the entire world can enjoy a cool space ship adventure!
Please make sure users are able to review the license, e.g. mentioning it on your homepage when you link to the game.

## Power-Ups
During your quests, there are some power-ups you can ease your journey with. Pay attention, they travel quickly! You pick them up by touching them.

#### Fire Boost (Red F)

Grants you the ability to auto-fire bullets by holding the fire button. If you pick this up again while auto-fire is still available, you receive additional Health Points.

#### Health Boost (Green H)

Grants you additional Health Points. Use the boost in order to heal yourself or to build up a shield reserve for dire situations. There is no limit on how many Health Points you may have.

#### Life Boost (Blue L)

Grants you an extra life. There is no limit on how many extra lifes you may have.

## Web browser compatibility

It is an aim for this game is to be fully compatible with modern Firefox and Chromium/Chrome browsers. If you encounter any issues please send us the error you are facing.


## Epilepsy warning

Some people tend to epilepsy triggered by (flashing) light effects. Theoretically, everyone can encounter this 
the first time. If you are known for this type of epilepsy or notice that something is off, immediately stop to play the game.

## HTML 5 Web Storage & Privacy

The progress of the game can be saved if the player wishes so. The technology HTML 5 local storage does save data in a storage
space managed by the used web browser per domain and protocol (i.e HTTP, HTTPS). In contrast to cookies, those data are NOT transferred to the server by default and in the case
of the game, they are not transferred at any given time. Some web browsers manage the usage of this function the same way as they do for
cookies. Some browsers might even state that the game does place cookies, but this is not completely the truth from a technical point of view. The game
progress you can save (this does not happen automatically!) cannot be used to identify you. Also, it is impossible for the hoster of the involved
web server to give you a copy of your game save and your own local storage space.
